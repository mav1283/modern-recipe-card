## Overview

Based on what i've learned i have implemented the use of css grid and flexbox, using root, variables, fonts and native css nesting.

### The challenge

The trickiest part of this challenge are the different list stye types, and making them responsive on mobile without destroying the text alignment, i had to use pseudo element ::before to make custom bullets and decimals.

## My process

- I started with the HTML5 semantics, getting the exact tags or containers for each part or components
- Adding the main tag for screen readers
- Combine the powers of flexbox and css grid to align and set things according the figma design
- Add external css for the reset, variables and fonts
- Use the figma design as reference by examining each component and knowing their properties.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Pseudo element list style

### What I learned

In this challenge i learned useful tips and tricks to customize the list style bullets an the use of dl, dt and dd tags for specific list that helps screen readers.
